# Seminar_Cardiac Biomarker Estimation in Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a common psychiatric disorder among underage women. Heart rate variability (HRV) calculated from the RRI of heartbeats is commonly used for long-term and 
short-term clinical AN monitoring. It also reflects changes in the balance of the autonomic nervous system under various stress conditions. Although body confrontation has gradually 
become one of the therapeutic for AN treatment, few previous studies have investigated the association between body confrontation and the changes in patients' cardiovascular system 
parameters. In this project, we assessed possible biomarkers from HRV measurements over the course of a body confrontation session and a whole therapy block (3-4 sessions) in AN 
patients and a body dissatisfied clinical control group (CG). We used Python platform to build an entire automatic processing pipeline with a series of statistical models to analyze the clinical 
experimental data. Our preliminary results indicate that, AN patient group experience less stress during the four body confrontation sessions compared to CG, as in time and non-linear 
domain HRV parameters were increased or decreased accordingly. However, only frequency domain parameter showed significant difference between two exposures, which could indicate 
AN patients experience more stress while being confronted to their lower body than upper body. A more balanced data set and further strategies to remove outliers are needed to achieve more 
meaningful results in the future with the developed pipeline.
